Very recently, I completed my PhD in Economics. But, as it goes with a PhD, I'm _still_ working on my thesis in my spare time.

My research explored absolute intergenerational mobility in the UK, investigating the trends over time, the differences across income distribution and potential repercussions in the society. I am currently working on (code word for mad rush to finish):

#### Falling Absolute Intergenerational Mobility
_Joint work with Jo Blanden and Stephen Machin_

Abstract: We present the trend in absolute mobility among 30 year old individuals in the UK for the 1963 to 1987 birth cohorts, using a new methodology by Chetty et al (2017) that accounts for data limitations using simple assumptions. We find that absolute mobility in the UK has plummeted over the last decade, mainly due to the fall in real earnings since the Great Recession. More than 60 percent of children born in 1978 earned as much or more than their fathers; a decade later, only about 41 percent of children do so - a decline of 22 percentage points. Our counterfactual simulations show that if real weekly earnings had continued to grow at just 2 percent annually since the Great Recession, absolute mobility could have been maintained at around 60 percent.
